		<h1>Step Two</h1>
		<h2>Is your thesis arguable?</h2>
		<p class="intro">For most papers, one of the most important components of your thesis that it is arguable. This means that a reasonable person might disagree with it, especially before being presented your evidence.</p>
		<div class="leftcol">
		<h3><img src="pencil.png"> To Do: </h3>
			<p>Write down a thesis about the same topic as yours, but that <span class="bold">makes an opposing argument.</span> If it sounds like something that no one would believe, your thesis might not be a good basis for an argument.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="example">
			<h3><img src="eyeglasses.png">Example:</h3>
			<p><span class="bad">Not very arguable: </span>"The TV show <title>Game of Thrones</title> uses violence to shock viewers."</p>
			<p>It would be tough to disagree with this, because it's such a broad statement. It can be improved by pushing a little further, and asking <span class="bold">why</span> the show uses violence.</p>
			<p><span class="good">More arguable: </span>"The TV show <title>Game of Thrones</title> makes its violent scenes shocking with cinematic techniques and plot twists that subvert fantasy tropes and audience expectations, and in doing so critiques the way the genre has desensitized its audience to violence."</p>
			<p>A <span class="bold">counter thesis</span> to this might be: "Game of Thrones's many scenes of violence are presented with cinematic techniques that aestheticize and glorify violence, distracting viewers from the humanity of victims." While one of these theses might turn out to be stronger than the other once you examine the evidence, both sound plausible, which means they're addressing a real problem.</p>
