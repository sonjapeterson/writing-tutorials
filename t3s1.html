		<h1>Step One</h1>
		<h2>Overall Structure: Write a Reverse Outline</h2>
		<p class="intro">It's easy to get bogged down in details when you're revising, so let's start by taking a look at your paper as a whole. Doing a reverse outline will help you see if the <span class="bold">structure</span> of your paper really supports your argument, and make sure there aren't any <span class="bold"> missing steps.</span></p>
		<div class="leftcol">
			<h3><img src="pencil.png"> To Do: </h3>
			<p>Re-read your paper. <span class="bold">For each body paragraph, write down one sentence</span> about what it's saying and how it moves your argument forward. Then, consider the questions to the right.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="example">
			<h3><img src="wrench.png">Strategies:</h3>
				<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Consider sequence:</span> Does the paragraphs go from making simpler claims to making more complex ones, with logical links from one to the next? If not, consider how you might rearrange them into a sequence that makes more sense.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Look for gaps:</span> Are there any "holes" in your argument&mdash;places where you might need to provide an additional paragraph between two others that don't seem to relate logically?</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Streamline:</span> Or, are there any redundancies&mdash;paragraphs that don't contribute to your argument, or can't be distinguished from other paragraphs?</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Focus:</span> Finally, are there any paragraphs for which you can't summarize the topic and what it contributes to its argument in a sentence or two? Those paragraphs might have too many ideas in them, and need to broken down into multiple paragraphs, or streamlined into a paragraph with one main claim.</li>
