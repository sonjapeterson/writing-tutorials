		<h1>Step Three</h1>
		<h2>Language: Streamline sentences</h2>
		<p class="intro">Usually, the more concise you can make your essay, the stronger it will be. Don't make your readers wade through useless sentences that just make your meaning murkier. Here's some strategies for <span class="bold">saying more with less:</span>
		<div class="leftcol">
			<h3><img src="pencil.png"> To Do: </h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Read each sentence carefully and consider whether you could get rid of a word without changing the meaning of the sentence. If you can, that word may not be contributing to your argument. <span class="bold">Adverbs and adjectives</span> are the usual suspects here.</li>
				<li>Where it's possible, <span class="bold">replace passive phrases</span> (The movie was criticized for...) with active ones (Roger Ebert criticized the movie for...) You've probably heard this before, but it's important because it forces you to be more precise, or at least think about the reasons you're avoiding mentioning the subject of a verb.</li>

		</div>
		<div class="example">
			<h3><img src="wrench.png">Strategies:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="bold">Read your essay out loud.</span> No, actually do it. It sounds silly, but it'll help you catch convoluted sentence structures. If it's awkward for you to read, it'll definitely be confusing for your readers.</li>
					<li><span class="bold">Get a fresh set of eyes.</span> This part of revision can be tricky because you are intimately familiar with your argument and what you want each word to mean, but not all readers will be. If you can find someone to read your essay through, this is a great time to do that. If you're burning the midnight oil and don't have anyone to help with that, then take a break before returning to your essay so that you can look at it with more detached eyes.</li>
