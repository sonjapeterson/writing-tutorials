		<h1>Step One</h1>
		<h2>Getting started</h2>
		<p class="intro">This tutorial is going to work best if you've got an idea about what you want to write. What question are you trying to answer, and how will you answer it? It's ok if your preliminary thesis is still pretty vague&mdash;just get something down on paper and we'll go from there.</p>
		<div class="leftcol">
		<h3><img src="pencil.png"> To do: </h3>
			<ul><li>Write down a sentence or two that sums up <span class="bold">the main argument</span> you want to make in your paper. If you have trouble gathering your thoughts, try explaining out loud what you're writing about to a friend, and then write down what you said.</li>
				<li>If you're having trouble conquering the fear of the blank page, one fix might be going back to your sources and doing some &nbsp<span class="bold">close reading</span>&mdash;try <a href="http://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/how-do-close-reading"> this guide</a> for more help.</li>

			<h3><img src="eyeglasses.png">Example:</h3>
			<p>Here's an example of what you might write as you're gathering your thoughts about a thesis:
			<p>"I'm writing about <title>Game of Thrones</title>. Some people think the show is unnecessarily violent, but I think they're wrong. I think it's just presenting violence differently, in a way that doesn't fit into the cliches and typical narratives of fantasy cinema, and by doing that it's actually trying to critique the way the genre sometimes trivializes violence."</p>
