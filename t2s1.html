		<h1>Step One</h1>
		<h2>Introduce and characterize</h2>
		<p class="intro">The first step in introducing a new source into your paper <span class="bold">identifying the writer and work</span> you’re quoting from, and <span class="bold">orienting readers</span> by giving them a sense of what the writer's overall argument is about. Think of it like introducing a new person to a conversation.</p>
		<div class="leftcol">
			<h3><img src="wrench.png">Strategies:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Fill in the blanks:</span> The usual structure is “In [title of work], [writer name]... followed by a phrase describing their argument.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Provide relevant context:</span> You don’t have to summarize the entire argument of the article. Just think about what would be relevant context for the point you're going to make.</li>

			<h3><img src="eyeglasses.png">Example:</h3>
			<p><span class="twoback">In <title>Jane Austen, or The Secret of Style</title>, D.A. Miller argues that Jane Austen’s narrative voice distinguishes itself precisely through its lack of distinguishing characteristics.</span> Selfless, androgynous, and inexplicable, it speaks with the authority of uncompromised anonymity. If Austenian style defines itself through the renunciation of personhood, however, then the end of <title>Mansfield Park</title> must represent a moment of rupture. In the last chapter of the novel, we find a narrator who seems to cultivate a unique identity as assiduously as Austen’s narrator spurns one. Announced by the frankly employed “I” and distinguished by a particular style and temporality, this narrator asserts a selfhood that is as engaging as that of any of the characters he describes.</p>
