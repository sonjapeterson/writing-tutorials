		<h1>Step Three</h1>
		<h2>Connect and expand</h2>
		<p class="intro">Next, <span class="bold">expand</span> on the relevant point you want to introduce from your secondary source. Even if you agree with the scholar, you should be introducing them in a way that adds value to what they have already said and <span class="bold">distinguishes</span> your argument from theirs. One of the easiest ways to do this is to disagree with a source, but that can be intimidating when you're reading the work of respected scholars. Don't worry! You don't have to undermine their whole argument in order to engage in a conversation.</p> 
		<div class="leftcol">
			<h3><img src="wrench.png">Strategies:</h3>
			<ul>
					<li><span class="bold">Find a problem or exception:</span> You can point out an inconsistency or exception to their argument (as the example to the right does).</li>
					<li><span class="bold">Take it a step further:</span> You can try to solve a problem that they point out with their argument.</li>
					<li><span class="bold">Take it somewhere else:</span> You can apply their work to a related topic or subject that they didn't consider. For example, you might reference a scholar's argument about an issue in Hamlet when writing a paper about another Shakespeare tragedy.</li>

			<h3><img src="eyeglasses.png">Example:</h3>
			<p>In <title>Jane Austen, or The Secret of Style</title>, D.A. Miller argues that Jane Austen’s narrative voice distinguishes itself precisely through its lack of distinguishing characteristics. Selfless, androgynous, and inexplicable, it speaks with the authority of uncompromised anonymity.If Austenian style defines itself through the renunciation of personhood, however, <span class="twoback">then the end of <title>Mansfield Park</title> must represent a moment of rupture. In the last chapter of the novel, we find a narrator who seems to cultivate a unique identity as assiduously as Austen’s narrator spurns one. Announced by the frankly employed “I” and distinguished by a particular style and temporality, this narrator asserts a selfhood that is as engaging as that of any of the characters he describes.</span></p>
