		<h2>Quote and reflect</h2>
		<p class="intro">Next, use quotation or paraphrase to present the most relevant point of your source. In quoting, you should also reflect critically on the quotation, analyzing context and language.</p>

			<h3><img src="wrench.png">Strategies:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Quote or paraphrase?</span> If you feel the passage introduces key terms, or you want to consider the specific language or sentence structure of your source, you should quote. But if you think you can express the main point of a source in more succinct language without losing meaning, you may choose to paraphrase.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">The rule of two:</span> If you quote directly from the source, consider the rule of two: you should include an explanation of or reflection on the importance of the quote that is twice as long as the quote itself.</li>

			<h3><img src="eyeglasses.png">Example:</h3>
			<p>In <title>Jane Austen, or The Secret of Style</title>, D.A. Miller argues that Jane Austen’s narrative voice distinguishes itself precisely through its lack of distinguishing characteristics.<span class="twoback"> Selfless, androgynous, and inexplicable, it speaks with the authority of uncompromised anonymity. If Austenian style defines itself through the renunciation of personhood,</span> however, then the end of <title>Mansfield Park</title> must represent a moment of rupture. In the last chapter of the novel, we find a narrator who seems to cultivate a unique identity as assiduously as Austen’s narrator spurns one. Announced by the frankly employed “I” and distinguished by a particular style and temporality, this narrator asserts a selfhood that is as engaging as that of any of the characters he describes.</p>
